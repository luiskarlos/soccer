>Simple Soccer demonstrates how team-based AI for a sports game can be created using only a handful of basic AI techniques.

As your knowledge of AI techniques and experience increase you will see many areas where the design of Simple Soccer can be improved or added to. For starters, though, you might like to try your hand at some of the following practice exercises.
